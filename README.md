![RadzionKit](https://kit.radzion.com/images/banner-2x.png)

RadzionKit is the ultimate solution for developers looking to jumpstart their projects without the stress of complex setups. Designed as a comprehensive monorepo, it provides an integrated suite of tools for full-stack development, from a robust UI library to streamlined backend services. With RadzionKit, you save valuable time both in kicking off new projects and during the development process, ensuring a smooth, efficient, and hassle-free coding experience. Embrace the power of simplicity and efficiency with RadzionKit — your partner in transforming coding challenges into coding triumphs.

## Monorepo Overview: Inside RadzionKit's Diverse Package Ecosystem

RadzionKit takes advantage of Yarn Workspaces to streamline a monorepo setup, organizing code into two primary directories: `lib` and `demo`. The `lib` folder houses generic code packages like `@lib/utils` or `@lib/ui`, designed to be project-agnostic and easily portable to any project without carrying over project-specific logic. On the other hand, the `demo` directory houses example implementations, such as `@demo/api` or `@demo/app`, that serve as blueprints demonstrating how to integrate and adapt the `@lib` packages to the unique needs of your project—simply replace `demo` with your project's name to customize. This thoughtful architecture not only streamlines the development process but also enhances the reusability of code, making it effortless to scale and modify your project as it grows.

| `@demo/api-interface`   | The `api-interface` package provides a structured TypeScript interface for the app's backend API, including error handling and method definitions, to ensure type safety and consistency across frontend and backend communications.             | TypeScript     |
| `@demo/api`             | The `api` package is a lightweight, TypeScript-based backend solution that faithfully implements the `api-interface` with minimal dependencies, primarily utilizing resolvers for handling requests.

## Getting Started with RadzionKit: Launching Your New Project

Initiate your project using RadzionKit from our GitHub template. The `demo` folder serves as a practical example, showcasing package integration — rename it to reflect your project's name or remove it if you prefer to start fresh. Update any `@demo` references to `@{project_name}`, install dependencies with `yarn`, and your setup is complete.

## Integrating RadzionKit's `lib` Packages into Your Monorepo

Select the `@lib` packages you require from RadzionKit and copy them into your monorepo. Be sure to include all associated dependencies; for example, if you choose `@lib/ui`, check if it necessitates `@lib/utils` and copy it as well. There's no need for renaming—these packages are designed to work out of the box. For practical examples of how these packages can be used within an application, refer to the implementations in the `demo` folder. After incorporating the desired packages, run `yarn` to install the dependencies, and your monorepo will be equipped with the versatile features of RadzionKit.

## Effortlessly Integrate RadzionKit's UI Package: Enhance Your Project's User Interface

1. **For NextJS Projects Only:** Update your `_document.tsx` file by extending the `StyledComponentsDocument` from the `@lib/next-ui` package, in order to integrate support for the `styled-components` library used in the `@lib/ui` package.

```tsx
import { StyledComponentsDocument } from '@lib/next-ui/StyledComponentsDocument'

class MyDocument extends StyledComponentsDocument {
  // ...
}
```

2. **For NextJS Projects Only:** Update your `next.config.js` to set `styledComponents` to `true` in the compiler options for proper styling, and include your UI package in `transpilePackages` to ensure Next.js correctly compiles and includes the UI package from the monorepo.

```javascript
const nextConfig = {
  // ...
  compiler: {
    styledComponents: true,
  },
  transpilePackages: ['@lib/ui'],
}
```

3. Add a `styled.d.ts` to your project and include the following content to integrate RadzionKit's theme with `styled-components`' default theme:

```typescript
import 'styled-components';
import { Theme } from '@lib/ui/theme/Theme';

declare module 'styled-components' {
  export interface DefaultTheme extends Theme {}
}
```

4. **Add `persistentState` File for Local Storage Interaction:** Place a `persistentState` file in the `state` folder of your app package to enhance local storage interaction. For detailed guidance, refer to this YouTube video: [Understanding Persistent State in React](https://youtu.be/_90rzlGy0SM).

```tsx
import { TemporaryStorage } from '@lib/ui/state/TemporaryStorage'
import { LocalStorage } from '@lib/ui/state/LocalStorage'
import { createPersistentStateHook } from '@lib/ui/state/createPersistentStateHook'
import { createPersistentStateManager } from '@lib/ui/state/createPersistentStateManager'

export enum PersistentStateKey {
  ThemePreference = 'themePreference',
}

const persistentStorage =
  typeof window !== 'undefined'
    ? new LocalStorage<PersistentStateKey>()
    : new TemporaryStorage<PersistentStateKey>()

export const usePersistentState =
  createPersistentStateHook<PersistentStateKey>(persistentStorage)

export const managePersistentState =
  createPersistentStateManager<PersistentStateKey>(persistentStorage)
```

5. **Implement `ThemeProvider` and `GlobalStyle` in Your App:** In your application, use the `ThemeProvider` from RadzionKit to manage theme changes and store user preferences with the `usePersistentState` hook. Include the `GlobalStyle` component to apply global CSS styles, such as font family and custom scrollbars, ensuring a consistent look and feel across your app.

```tsx
import { GlobalStyle } from '@lib/ui/css/GlobalStyle'
import { Inter } from 'next/font/google'
import { PersistentStateKey, usePersistentState } from '@demo/app/state/persistentState'
import { ThemePreference } from '@lib/ui/theme/ThemePreference'
import { DarkLightThemeProvider } from '@lib/ui/theme/DarkLightThemeProvider'

const inter = Inter({
  subsets: ['latin'],
  weight: ['400', '500', '600', '800'],
})

export const App = () => {
  const [theme, setTheme] = usePersistentState<ThemePreference>(
    PersistentStateKey.ThemePreference,
    'system',
  )

  return (
    <DarkLightThemeProvider value={theme} onChange={setTheme}>
      <GlobalStyle fontFamily={inter.style.fontFamily} />
      // ...
    </DarkLightThemeProvider>
  )
}
```
