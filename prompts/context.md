# Radzion Chachura

Based in Georgia (country), I am seeking a front-end position in web3 and am also open to full-stack roles.

## Job Experience

### Front-end Engineer at Terraform Labs (Mar 2022 - Aug 2024)

At Terraform Labs, I worked on **Anchor Protocol**, one of the largest DeFi protocols in web3 at the time. Using React and TypeScript, I contributed new features to the app.

I was part of the team developing two NFT protocols on Terra, where I was responsible for building the front-end for both projects using React/Next.js and TypeScript.

Later, I took charge of both the front-end and back-end of **Enterprise Protocol**â€”a DAO management tool for the Terra ecosystem that allowed protocols to manage their treasury and governance, and enabled users to participate in governance. It supported NFT DAOs, Token DAOs, and multi-sigs. We added cross-chain support for other Cosmos chains, allowing DAOs to create treasuries on different Cosmos chains while keeping the governance on Terra.

The project was built within a TypeScript monorepo, with React/Next.js on the front-end and Node.js with DynamoDB on the back-end. The back-end consisted of an API and an indexer. The Enterprise Protocol had $65 million in treasury holdings at its peak. The project was initiated using **RadzionKit** and is actually a fork of it.

### Front-end Engineer at IOG (Sep 2021 - Feb 2022)

At IOG, I worked on [Lace](https://www.lace.io/), a Cardano light wallet built with React and TypeScript. I was involved in developing the NFT gallery, balances, transaction history, and general product improvements.

### Front-end Engineer at Zerion (Oct 2020 - Aug 2021)

At Zerion, I worked on the [Zerion web app](https://app.zerion.io/) built with React and TypeScript. I was responsible for wallet management and integrations with different wallets, improving the user experience when exchanging tokens, adding staking features, and implementing internationalization support.

### Senior Software Engineer at Kontist (Jul 2019 - Sep 2020)

At Kontist, I worked as a full-stack engineer. I was involved in improving the onboarding and account creation process, adding new features to the app, and helping to launch a web app for the product. I worked with React Native on the mobile app, Node.js with PostgreSQL on the back-end, and React with TypeScript on the web app.

### Software Developer at KREO (Apr 2017 - Jun 2019)

At KREO, I was one of the first developers of and was responsible for the web stack of a construction and architecture software - [KREO](https://www.kreo.net/). I led the development of the web app built with React and TypeScript and was responsible for key features like a construction site management tool that allowed editing the site directly on the map, and a floor plan editor that enabled creating and editing floor plans of buildings, moving walls, windows, doors, etc. I also managed infrastructure using Terraform and AWS, and developed the API for the app built with Node.js, GraphQL, and DynamoDB.

## My Projects

### Increaser ([increaser.org](https://increaser.org/))

Increaser is a productivity toolkit developed specifically for knowledge workers, offering a suite of tools that support vision planning, goal tracking, time management, habit development, among others. The app, built as a TypeScript monorepo and hosted on AWS with Terraform, is optimized as a PWA and enables users to organize their tasks, manage work budgets, and schedule focused work sessions. Each tool is meticulously designed to help remote workers and digital professionals enhance productivity and create a better work-life balance. As the sole founder, I have led its development, handling all technical, architectural, and deployment aspects to deliver a powerful, accessible productivity solution. It has a great UX/UI that I crafted over the years.

It's structured as a TypeScript monorepo and designed for a stack with React (optional Next.js), Node.js, DynamoDB, and Terraform (AWS). Most of the code is for the front-end and contains a lot of reusable components, hooks, and utilities built without depending on any UI library. The project has more than 200 stars on GitHub.
