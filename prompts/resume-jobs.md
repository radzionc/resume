Fill the `responsibilities` prop for each position in my resume with concise, impactful bullet points—no more than four per role. Reduce the number of points if I had fewer contributions in that position due to shorter tenure.

When listing responsibilities, you may reference projects using the `ProductLink` component, but only if the project’s URL has been mentioned previously. The `ProductLink` component takes a `to` prop for the URL. To highlight a technology, use the `Tech` component. The `responsibilities` prop expects an array of `React.Node`. Do not repeat the same technology within a single job. You do not need to highlight every technology used in that role; use your best judgment.
